For my interview test preparation with inManage, I utilized phpMyAdmin as the server. Here's a detailed breakdown of the steps I followed:

1.I created a Database class, incorporating a constructor that initializes the login information and database name. I then developed all the essential database functions.
2.I created three tables: users, posts, and a table dedicated to storing photos that I uploaded to the server as instructed in the worksheet.
3.I populated these tables with the required data, ensuring to exclude any duplicate entries as per the guidelines in the worksheet.
4.I devised a function capable of displaying all the posts from any active user, akin to a social media feed. This function presents the user's name and email first, followed by their photo, and then lists all their posts.
